# Ghosy
Ghosy is an endless run game.
You can tap once to do a small jump, twice to do a longer jump.
On the screen you are going to see some elements:

- Player: a small red will'o wisp trying to escape from the graveyard;
- Bones: collectible that help you improve your score;
- Ghosts and tombstones: obstacles you have to avoid.
